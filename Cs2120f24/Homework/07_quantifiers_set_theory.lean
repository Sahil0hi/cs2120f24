/-! #1 [20 points] Reasoning about set membership (no proofs involved)

Suppose s, t, and r are sets of natural numbers, defined as follows.
-/

def s : Set Nat := { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }
def t : Set Nat := { n | n = 3 \/ n = 4 \/ n = 5 }
def r : Set Nat := { n | ∃ m, n = m + 1 }

Use *display notations* to express the membership of each
of the following sets. Here's an example. You fill in to the
right of the :=. Then it's your turn.

-- 0. s ∩ t
def q0 : Set Nat := { 3, 4 }


-- 1. s ∩ r
def q1 : Set Nat := { 1, 2, 3, 4 }


/-!
For the remaining problems, you can write the whole definition.
Remember, use *display notation* in all your answers. We want to
see that you can figure out, on your own, what values are in each
of the specified sets.

-- 2. q2 = s \ t
def q2 : Set Nat := { 0, 1, 2 }


-- 3. q3 = t \ s
def q3 : Set Nat := { 5 }

def q4 : Set (Nat × Nat) := { (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1) }

Prove that 5 is not a member of q0.

Remember two things: (1) 5 ∉ q0 means ¬(5 ∈ q0);
(2) that in turn means (5 ∈ q0) → False, which in
turn is an implication. You have to be able to do
this kind of reasoning on your own. Prove 5 ∉ q0
as an implication!

In addition to a formal proof, give a proof in English, explaining the
precise logical reasoning that leads to this conclusion. Start by stating
the underlying logical proposition that needs to be proved, and identify
explicitly the first step you must therefore take (what inference rule
you will apply) to construct a proof.

Here:

--By the definition of r, not in r means there exists a nat number m such that (n = m + 1.
--Therefore, 0 in r would imply that there exists M in N such that (0 = m + 1).
-- However, for any M in N, M+1 >=1. Thus, m + 1 not equal to 0.

You are to prove that the empty set is in the
powerset of t. Remember that the powerset of t
is the set of all subsets of t, including both
the empty, and the full, subsets of t. Clearly
the proposition is true. But what exactly is to
be proved, and how do you prove it?

The answer is that you just need to show that
∅ is a subset of t! This is how you'd proceed
in a natural language proof description. Ok, so
now what's required to show ∅ ⊆ t? You need to
remind yourself what it means for one set, a,
to be subset of another, b.

That challenge with proofs like this one in set
theory is to see how set theoretical propositions
reduce to propositions in predicate logic. Just
prove the corresponding logical proposition.

Use top-down proof construction. Once you remember
the definition of *subset* you should see just how
to start.

Now give a corresponding English-language proof. Here:

Prove: ∅ ∈ 𝒫 t
Proof: To show that ∅ ∈ 𝒫 t (which is the set of all
subsets of t) we need to show that ∅ (the empty set)
is a subset of t. By the definition of subset, what we
thus need to show is ___. [Proceed from here]. To prove
that we first ...

--To show that ∅ ∈ 𝒫 t , we need to show that the empty set is a subset of t. By the definition of subset, we need to show that for all elements x
--if x in ∅(subset) then x in t. Since there are no elements in ∅, the statement "if x \in ∅ then x \in t" is vacuously true.
--Therefore, ∅ is a subset of t, and thus ∅ ∈ 𝒫 t.

Formally prove (t \ { 5 }) ⊆ s.

Here we ask you first to understand most of the
formal proof and then to finish it off given that
you understand it and you see how to finish off two
small remaining proofs at the end of the day.

To help you understand how to reason in this case,
we first explain that \ show that for any n, if n ∈ (t \ { 5 })
then n ∈ s. Before you go on make absolutely sure
you fully understand why this is what needs to be
proved. Go back again if you need to and read and
understand the formal specification of the subset
operator; then prove that that underlying logical
proposition holds in this case. You'll need to see
that at top level, you must prove a ∀ proposition;
then you must prove a → proposition. You need to
remember that proofs of each involve first making
an assumption, and then showing that the conclusion
follows in that context.

Provide a detailed English-language proof of the proposition
in the preceding problem: (t \ { 5 }) ⊆ s. Use the commented
formal proof as a basis for writing a proof in English. Make
sure you refer to specific proof techniques (which axioms of
logic are you employing) at each level of English language
proof. Here's a way to get started.

Problem: Prove (t \ { 5 }) ⊆ s.



Proof. By the definition of ⊆ what we need to prove is that
∀ (n : Nat), n ∈ (t \ { 5 }) → n ∈ s. We begin by assuming
first that n is some arbitrary natural number (∀ intro). We
next, by → intro, assume that n ∈ (t \ { 5 }). In the context
of these assumptions our remaining goal is to prove n ∈ s.
The proof of this proposition is by looking at the set difference,
\(n ∈ (t \ {5})\) means that \(n ∈ t\) and \(n ∉ \{5\}\) (conjunction elimination).
From this we can deduce that \(n ∈ \{3, 4, 5\}\) (by conjunction elimination).
